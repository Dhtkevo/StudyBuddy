## Reflection

This was a group project built during my Application Development II course. Since we are college students, we aimed to create an application that would solve some common problems that university students commonly face.

The StudyBuddy application is composed of 3 components, a task management component, a course management component (**My assigned component**), and an event management componenet.

This project was challenging because not only was it one of my first times developing an application as part of a team, we also had to learn so many new technologies within an incredibly short amount of time. For example, Jira, ASP.NET Core MVC, XUnit, etc.
Also, this project introduced us to the concept of integration testing.

Unexpected obstacles that we faced include working around our separate schedules, figuring out the basics of ASP.NET Core MVC, and planning out the project with Jira.

I feel that this project has provided me the opportunity to learn invaluable skills such as communication and collaboration within a development context, how to quickly pick up a completely new technology to accomplish a task, and the importance of planning out the project.
